# AR/VR Portfolio Project ‚Äì VR Language Learning Flashcards  

## üìå Description  
This project is part of the **[C#23] Spe - AR/VR 2024 Curriculum** at Holberton School.  
The goal is to create a **Virtual Reality experience** that helps users learn Japanese vocabulary in an immersive way.  
The player explores a stylized Japanese city and interacts with objects to reveal **flashcards** containing vocabulary data (kanji, kana, romaji, and definitions).  

This project emphasizes **interaction**, **educational value**, and **VR accessibility**.
